## Clustering Employee Absenteeism: Identifying Top Contributors and Developing Targeted Interventions

• Education level is a factor that affects absenteeism at work. Employees with education level 1 tend to be more absent compared to other employees. This information    could be useful for employers to develop targeted interventions for employees with lower levels of education.

• The most commonly cited reason for absence among employees with education level 1 is Reason 23. Employers could investigate this reason further to determine if       there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed.

• Social drinkers are more likely to use reasons 0, 13, 19, and 28 for their absence. Employers may want to consider providing resources or support for employees who   struggle with alcohol use.

• Employees who are social drinkers are most commonly absent for 8 hours. This information could be useful in identifying patterns of absenteeism and developing         targeted interventions.

• Reason for absence 0 is associated with disciplinary failure. Employers could use this information to review their disciplinary policies and procedures to ensure     they are effective in preventing absenteeism related to disciplinary issues.

In summary, the provided data can help employers understand patterns of absenteeism among their employees and develop targeted interventions to address the underlying causes. Employers may want to consider using this information to develop a targeted approach that considers factors such as education level and alcohol use.
